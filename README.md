# citibike

This project was created using R and the Shiny library. Its goal is to analyze CitiBike trip data in New York City to identify the top five most popular trip destinations in the city.
Analyses and visualizations:

1. Interactive map: the application displays an interactive map with markers for the most popular CitiBike stations as destinations.
2. Top 5 destinations: users can view the top five most popular destination stations based on historical data.
3. Data filtering: the application allows users to filter and check the most popular destination stations for any selected day and time, enabling detailed analysis of bike usage patterns.
